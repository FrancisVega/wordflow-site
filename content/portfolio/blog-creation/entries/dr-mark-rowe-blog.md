With Dr Mark’s site, the key challenge was to find a voice commensurate with the work he is trying to do in the areas of self-help, empowerment, and self-improvement. Mark had already released a book and there was a variety of literature around his work so it was important that there was a consistency of tone throughout. We’re proud to say that we achieved this with Mark’s site and went on to copy-edit a number of blogs for the site having been provided with input from Mark, It was a challenging, but satisfying product and we’re sure you’ll be hearing more from Dr. Mark in the future.
