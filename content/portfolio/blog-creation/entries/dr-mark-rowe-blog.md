Dr. Mark is an extremely busy man with his medical practice and his regular speaking spots at seminars and events. He has a lot to say, but little time to write. To remedy this, he would provide us with notes he had made about what it is he would like to communicate in a blog. We took these notes and reshaped them into engaging material for his followers to enjoy, and of course, to increase his visibility in the world of self-care.
