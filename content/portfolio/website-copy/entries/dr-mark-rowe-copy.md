Dr. Mark is an extremely busy man with his medical practice and his regular speaking spots at seminars and events. He has a lot to say, but little time to write. As a result he would provide us with notes he had made about what it is he would like to communicate in a blog, which we were then able to reshape into engaging material for his followers to enjoy, and of course to increase his visibility in the world of self-care.
