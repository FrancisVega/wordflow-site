With Settle Service, effective communication was paramount. It is a large detailed website with separate sections geared towards businesses and individuals. With such a large amount of information to communicate, it was essential that the voice of the organisation be established from day one. Once this was achieved through questionnaires and discussions, we quickly developed the copy for the website in the professional yet accommodating tone suitable to the enterprise. We have since undertaken the copy editing of an extensive manual which they provide to their clients.
